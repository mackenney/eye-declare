///     EventResult::Consumed
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Reading state without marking dirty
///
/// **Important:** on `&mut Tracked<S>`, Rust's auto-deref uses [`DerefMut`]
/// for *all* field access — even reads. This means `state.some_field` sets
/// dirty even when you only read the value. Use [`read()`](Tracked::read)
/// to get a shared reference that goes through [`Deref`] instead:
///
/// ```ignore
/// fn handle_event(&self, event: &Event, state: &mut Tracked<Self::State>) -> EventResult {

///         EventResult::Consumed
///     } else {
